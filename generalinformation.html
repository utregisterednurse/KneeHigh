    I am closed on all major
    holidays, including New Years, Christmas, July 4th, Memorial Day, Labor
    Day, Thanksgiving. I normally close early on Christmas Eve,
    depending on family activity plans. There are days when I’ll have to be
    closed for Doctor Appointments, Dental Appointments, or become sick.
    PLEASE have alternate care plans for those days. I have a chronic
    medical condition and pick up respiratory viruses easily. Please don’t send
    a sick child to daycare, I will catch any virus and that means I have to close
    till I’m well. Please refer to the COVID-19 form for our plan to deal with
    that. IF anyone tests positive for that, I will have to close until I can sanitize
    everything properly. Also if I’m exposed that means a two week
    quarantine-which means I’ll be closed for 2 weeks. Let’s keep each other
    safe! <br><br>
    <strong>VACATION:</strong> I take some long weekends around Holidays and normally
    take 2 weeks off to visit my grandkids in California, each year. I will give
    ample advance notice so alternate care plans can be made. <br><br>
    <strong>QUIET/NAP TIME:</strong> We have a ‘rest’ time every day after lunch. Children
    are not required to take a nap, however, they are required to stay on their
    mat and let the nappers rest. Non-Nappers can color, read, listen to
    stories, etc. during quiet time, as long as they stay on their nap mat and be
    quiet. Please don’t drop off or pick up during quiet time, it disrupts and
    wakes the nappers up. <br><br>
    <strong>MEALS:</strong> I do not provide meals at this time. Pack a breakfast, lunch and
    afternoon snack daily. There are state rules that regulate how and when
    meals can be served and it’s imperative that we follow those guidelines,
    which includes me sitting with the children and watching them in case
    someone chokes. Please don’t drop off or pick up during scheduled meal
    times if at all possible. If you absolutely need to drop off or pick up please
    give me ample notice so I can have things organized for you.
    Revised Aug 2020
    Please pack healthy meals and not sugary foods and drinks. It helps the
    children control their emotions during the day. Chocolate or any flavored
    milk isn’t permitted until 6 years old-per state rules, so water or plain milk
    only please. Juice is allowed up to ¼-½ cup (depending on age), 100%
    juice once a day, again per state rules. It’s easiest to skip juice altogether
    and save that for home! I sure appreciate it! Please make sure children
    are here, signed in prior to meal times because we are not permitted to eat
    outside the specified meal times.
    Breakfast is served between 8-9am ONLY.
    Lunch is served from 11:30-12:15 ONLY.
    Afternoon snacks are served around 3:30 or when everyone wakes up
    from nap. <br><br>
    <strong>BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT:</strong> Biting : Biting generally happens when a child
    feels overwhelmed, tired or frustrated. My procedure for dealing with biting is to
    separate the children involved, any wounds will be cared for (washed and bandaged if
    necessary), comfort given; an incident report is mandatory and will be given to all
    parents involved, and the biter will be redirected to another play activity. However, if
    biting is a continuous issue, dismissal could be possible in order to protect the other
    children.<br><br>
    <strong>OTHER DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR</strong> - Normally disruptive behavior is best dealt with
    by talking about what’s going on, redirecting, etc. If disruptive behavior becomes an
    issue I’ll notify the parents and try to come up with a helpful course of action. If that
    doesn’t help, I reserve the right to dismiss that child from care.<br><br>
    <strong>BULLYING</strong>- Will NOT be tolerated. Bullying has three elements: it’s an act of
    aggression and intended to do harm; these actions are repeated over time; and, they
    occur within the context of power imbalance. In other words, it is a series of acts
    intended to hurt another child, committed by a child to gain or to assert greater power
    over another child.. Bullying can be physically aggressive, but can also be verbal (name
    calling), or social (social exclusion) in nature. My prevention plan is:<br><br>
    ● Take Charge- Understand the variety of ways early childhood educators
    can prevent bullying before it starts, intervene when it happens, and follow
    up after it occurs <br>
    ● Talk with young children about bullying. Dealing with bullying directly and
    openly lets everyone know that bullying is an important concern, that it will
    Revised Aug 2020 <br>
    not be tolerated, and that everyone needs to work together to stop and
    prevent it. <br>
    ● Teach and guide children in practicing the social skills they need to help
    stop and prevent bullying. <br>
    ● Engage children in activities to develop the empathy skills they need to
    refrain from, stop, and prevent bullying. <br>
    ● Work to develop and maintain a common vision of a bullying-free
    environment.<br>
    ● Document - I will document incidents of bullying and parents will be
    notified.<br><br>
  <strong>  I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE ANY CHILD AT ANY TIME
    FOR ANY REASON.</strong> Per DHS guidelines, Prior to expulsion other
    options can be considered such as reduction of attendance days or times ,
    referrals to the Center on the Social and Emotional Foundations for Early
    Learning, Early Intervention System or Individuals with Disabilities Act
    services.<br><br>
    <strong>COMMUNICATION:</strong> I will always be available to parents during work
    hours, especially in the morning at drop off or evenings during pick up
    hours. I will provide a monthly Newsletter that outlines our plan for the
    month and have a Highlights Board by the door, and maintain a Bulletin
    Board for helpful information.<br><br>
    <strong>MEDICATION:</strong> I do not give medications. If a child needs medication
    please give it prior to drop-off. Parents are welcomed to stop in during the
    day, other than nap time, to give meds if needed.<br><br>
    <strong>SNOW DAYS:</strong> 2 children minimum to stay open on snow days because
    they get bored if there’s no friends to play with.<br><br>
    <strong>EMERGENCIES:</strong> They happen; Children get hurt, so if there is an
    emergency I’ll notify parents by text or call, then proceed to the emergency
    contact form contacts UNLESS the situation requires immediate response,
    Revised Aug 2020
    in which case I’ll call an ambulance. Parents will be responsible for any
    expenses in that case. It’s imperative that the emergency contact
    information, including phone numbers, be kept current.<br><br>
    <strong>MANDATORY REPORTING:</strong> Everyone in Tennessee is a mandated reporter
    under state law. Any person with reasonable cause to believe a child is
    being abused or neglected must, under the law, immediately report to the
    Tennessee Department of Children's Services or to local law enforcement.
    The reporter can remain anonymous.
    THIS INCLUDES DROPPING OFF OR PICKING UP A CHILD WHILE UNDER
    THE INFLUENCE. No child will be released to anyone suspected of being
    UTI.<br><br>
    <strong>This is a No Smoking Facility</strong>, including the playground area. This is also a
    welcoming and accepting facility. We do not discriminate based on Gender
    Identification, Race, Religious Affiliation, etc.<br><br>
    <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL EMERGENCY PROCEDURE:</strong>
    In the event of an emergency that necessitates evacuating the facility our
    pick up area is at the far side of the yard by the rabbit enclosure. If we
    must evacuate the yard, our pick up area is across the street at the
    neighbors house, Kathleen Williamson, 422 Washington Ave. 423-248-3143.
    If we must evacuate the neighborhood, our evacuation pick up area is the
    first floor of the courthouse. These emergency contingencies were made
    with and approved by the Cocke County Emergency Services Director. If
    you’d like to review our evacuation/emergency procedure book it’s
    available for review at any time. It includes a form with medical
    information, contact information and a photo of each child. <br><br>
    <strong>Parking</strong> - Please park alongside the street in MY yard, not on my neighbors
    side of the street. Limit parking to 5 minutes so everyone can get signed
    in/out as quickly as possible since the sign in area is small and only one
    parent at a time will fit in that space.
