    <p>
      As the owner of Knee High Child Care, I strive daily to provide a place where children
      are encouraged and loved. I truly believe that children thrive when they’re happy and
      secure and so our days are spent learning and playing, both together and individually.
      Research proves that children do their best learning when they have a balance between
      structured activities and self-guided activities, or as we call it, between teacher led
      learning activities and free play time.
      Here they’ll receive teacher guided learning every morning, including Language skills,
      Music, S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) activities which
      may look like collecting bugs and looking at them, learning about their life cycles,
      freezing ice cubes, learning to count by making butter, making buildings out of boxes,
      etc). Art and Dramatic Play. Study also shows that the development of social skills is
      the most important indicator of later career and life success, therefore, I place high
      importance on working on their social skills. We also follow the County Guide for
      Kindergarten Preparedness so that when that time comes they’ll be ready to move on to
      ‘Big Kid School’.
      We place a very high importance on learning to play and work together, caring for each
      other, being outside in nature as much as possible, working through our adversities, and
      celebrating our successes, which may look like typical playground activities, caring for
      our pets, working and learning about things in our garden, and plain old having fun
      together. It all adds up to a full day of learning and playing with our friends.<br><br>
      Sincerely,<br><br>
